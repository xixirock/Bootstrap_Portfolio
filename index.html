                            Hello, my name is Jason Lin. I'm mostly known as that quirky asian on the block. I was an American Born Taiwanese, and look forward to meet you should we have the chance in the future.

                            I graduated from UCR (University of California Riverside) and received a BA in Media studies, specifically focused on game development (story content, analysis and what not), movies, and commercial. While I was in college, I had taken Japenses to fulfill my language requirement, since it has been one of my interested subject for many years. After graduated, I thought to myself, "why not go for the extra mile and completely perfect my Japanese?" It was that crazy thought that led me became an international student in Japan for a year. Earned my JLPT 1(Japanese Language Proficiency Test) certification (and a lot of weight cause cheap ramens are goooooood!!)

                            I had worked in varieties of job field. I had worked as a photographer for UCR Highlander Newspaper, line cook of a japanese restaurant, and as an English Teacher in Japan's cram school. I am now working as a sales, or a fragrance expert(not really, I still need to learn) for Bloomingdale's Jo Malone. I'm currently taking UCI's Coding Bootcamp in order to enrich my resume, as well as gaining an understanding in web development and data storage management.

                            I had invested great interest in games, camera, and basically anything that concerns with picture/cgi.
